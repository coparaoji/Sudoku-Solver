#### Results

#### Final words
1. It would have been more reliable to use a ConvNN to locate the board. That would however require a labeled dataset of sudoku images which I presently don't have.
2. Back tracking works to solve sudoku all the time but a more efficient method exist; *insert method here*. It doesn't work all the time but it could be used first then backtracking sould be a fallback option.
